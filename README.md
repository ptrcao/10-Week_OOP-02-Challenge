## Project Description
The project provides a Node.js command-line application, which allows a hypothetical manager to input information about his team in order to display card summaries of each member.  The project makes use of the npm package Inquirer.js in order to facilitate the collection of data about the employees of interest.

## Installation
Simply download the source code and run `node index.js` in command line.

## Usage
Simply answer each question in turn to populate information to the employee cards.  Once complete, view the html file on a local server.  The html file will take on the name of the project.

## Tests
Simply run `npm test` in command line.  There are tests for each employee class and an additional test to ensure the conditional display of information works as intended.

## Contributions
Public contributions are welcome.  Simply reach out to the developer at the listed GitHub account to discuss possibilities.
